When play begins: say "You can LOOK, TYPE a number, or move N S E W."

The maximum score is 1.

UnlockBit is a number that varies. UnlockBit is 0.

	Section - The Situation

	There is a room called the Locked Room.

	The Hallway is a room.

	The exit door is a closed locked door. It is south of the Hallway and north of the Locked Room.

	After going through the exit door: increment the score; end the story saying "You have escaped!"

	Section - The Lock

The combination lock is fixed in place in the Locked Room. The numeric keypad is part of the combination lock. The display is part of the combination lock. The description of the combination lock is "This lock has a numeric keypad and a display. You can LOOK at the display, and TYPE numbers on the keypad."

The display reading is an indexed text that varies. The display reading is "".

The description of the display is "(^0^)".

Instead of examining the display when UnlockBit is 0:
clear the screen;
say "A digital read-out printing the same message in a loop:[paragraph break]";
say "6734 576 07734[paragraph break]";
say fixed letter spacing;
say " 0 [line break]";
say " | [line break]";
say "/ \ [line break]";
say "===============--------==== [line break]";
say "               ^^^^^^^^[line break]";
wait for any key;
clear the screen;
say "A digital read-out printing the same message in a loop:[paragraph break]";
say "6734 576 07734[paragraph break]";

say "    0 [line break]";

Typing it on is an action applying to one topic and one touchable thing and requiring light. Understand "type [text] on [thing]" or "type [text]" as typing it on. Rule for supplying a missing second noun while typing when the numeric keypad is touchable: now the second noun is the numeric keypad.

Instead of typing on when the second noun is not the numeric keypad: say "I don't see how to type on that."

Check typing a text on the numeric keypad: if the topic understood exactly matches the regular expression "\d+", say "The keypad clicks merrily."; otherwise instead say "I don't see how to type that on a numeric keypad."

Carry out typing a text on the numeric keypad: now the display reading is "[display reading][topic understood]"; now the display reading is the text matching regular expression.
